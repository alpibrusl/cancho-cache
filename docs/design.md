# lexsys-cache: a Redis-compatible cache in lex-sys

Status: **design, nothing built.** Every number below is a measurement of Redis, not of this project.

## 1. What this is for, and the claim it must survive

A byte-string key/value cache that speaks enough of RESP2 for `redis-benchmark` and a normal client to use it, built on
lex-sys with no `Ffi`, no `unsafe`, and an authority report (`lex-sys authority`) that a reader can check. The performance
claim is deliberately modest: **at one core, not meaningfully slower than Redis.** If it is slower, this document says so
and the project stops being "a faster Redis" and becomes, at most, "a Redis with a checkable authority report".

Why it should be possible at all (measured elsewhere, `lex-sys/docs/parallelism.md`): lex-sys's `http.server` loop (epoll,
non-blocking, one core) served about 95,000 requests a second with a full JSON parse and schema validation per request.
A RESP command is far cheaper to parse than that, and Redis itself is a single-threaded event loop, so the comparison is the
same *shape* of program. It is not a measurement of the cache; it is the reason the experiment is worth its first week.

## 2. The gate, fixed before the code

**Baseline (this machine, Redis 7.0.15, jemalloc, `--save "" --appendonly no`, server pinned to core 0, `redis-benchmark`
`-c 50 -n 1000000 --threads 2` pinned to cores 2-3, default 3-byte value, three runs):**

| | SET | GET |
|---|---|---|
| pipeline 1 | 142,633 147,863 147,951 | 153,563 147,842 142,816 |
| pipeline 16 | 999,001 998,004 999,001 | 1,333,333 999,001 1,331,558 |

Pipeline-16 figures are quantised (they repeat to the digit) and may be limited by the load generator, not by Redis. Before
any pipeline-16 comparison is quoted, the client cores' CPU use is recorded; a client that is saturated reports **"client-
bound"** and no ratio.

**Criterion (pre-registered): median of at least five runs of the cache, interleaved with Redis in the same session, at least
0.9 times Redis in each of the four cells (SET and GET, pipeline 1 and 16, 3-byte values).** 256-byte values (`-d 256`) are
measured and reported, not gated. If any cell misses, the result says which and by how much, and the README does not say
"as fast as Redis".

**Not compared:** multiple cores. Redis scales by running more processes and clients that shard; a cache that shares one
store across threads needs the communication primitive that lex-sys does not have (`parallelism.md`, T5). One core against
one core is the only fair claim today.

## 3. Correctness gates (these come first)

1. **Differential test.** One command sequence, replayed against Redis and against this cache, replies compared byte for byte
   for the supported subset, in four framings: whole commands, one byte at a time, random splits, and pipelined batches.
2. **No input reaches a trap.** A malformed or hostile frame is answered with `-ERR` and the connection continues or closes;
   it never traps the process. (lex-sys's own rule: no input may reach a panic.) A mutation-style fuzz over the parser, with
   the corpus kept in the repo.
3. **Memory is bounded** by `maxmemory`, counted by the cache itself, and never exceeded under a SET flood larger than it.
4. **Authority**: `lex-sys authority` shows `net_in`, `conn_*`, `poll`, `clock`, `heap`, `args` and no `ffi`; CI diffs it.

## 4. Command set (the first slice)

`PING`, `ECHO`, `GET`, `SET key value [EX s | PX ms] [NX | XX]`, `DEL`, `EXISTS`, `INCR`/`DECR`, `EXPIRE`/`PEXPIRE`, `TTL`/`PTTL`,
`DBSIZE`, `FLUSHALL`, `INFO` (a short fixed reply), and whatever handshake `redis-benchmark` and `redis-cli` send
(`COMMAND`, `CONFIG GET`, `HELLO`: refused with the standard error, as Redis does for a RESP3 request on a RESP2 server).
Everything else answers `-ERR unknown command`. Lists, hashes, sets, sorted sets, streams, pub/sub, scripting, transactions,
persistence and replication are **non-goals** for this project.

## 5. Design

**Protocol: sans-io, like `http.server`.** A RESP2 parser that is a pure function from `(buffer, position)` to
`(command, bytes consumed)`, `need more`, or `error`, with no allocation on the parse of a well-formed array of bulk strings
(it returns offsets into the connection's input buffer). The server loop is `http.server`'s: `wait`, `next`, `respond`, with
the HTTP parser replaced. Whether `http.server`'s connection table can be reused as it is, or only its pieces
(`std.conns`), is the first thing step C0 finds out; the package is HTTP-shaped in its names and may need a small split.

**Storage: a log, not a heap of values.** `std.map` holds `val` values (copyable), and a value here is a byte string of any
length. So the map is an **index** from key to `{offset, length, expires_at}` into a **value log**, one large `Box[[byte]]`
arena written from the head: a SET appends the value (and, for a replaced key, the old record becomes garbage); the map
points at the new one. This is the same idea as a log-structured store, and it buys three things the alternative (one
allocation per value) does not: no per-value allocator metadata, no fragmentation, and **eviction and compaction are the
same operation** (copy the live records of the oldest segment forward, drop the rest). It costs a copy per compaction, which
the benchmark will show or not. `maxmemory` is the arena size plus the index, counted exactly.

**Expiry** is lazy (checked on access) plus a bounded sweep per loop iteration; time comes from `Clock`. No timer thread.

**Eviction** when full: drop the oldest segment (FIFO), or compact it if more than a threshold of it is live. LRU/LFU are
non-goals for the first slice and would be judged against a hit-rate measurement, not assumed.

**One core, one process, one thread.** Scaling is by running several processes on several ports, as for the `users` server.

## 6. Plan, each step with its own gate

| step | what | gate |
|---|---|---|
| C0 | RESP parser + loop answering `PING`/`ECHO`; the differential harness (Redis is the oracle) | parser fuzz clean; differential test green on the subset; `redis-benchmark -t ping` ratio recorded |
| C1 | `GET`/`SET`/`DEL`/`EXISTS` on a fixed-size log and index | the pre-registered cells, measured; each miss reported |
| C2 | expiry, `INCR`, `maxmemory` and eviction | memory gate (3) under a flood; hit-rate on a skewed workload recorded, not gated |
| C3 | whatever the C1 profile says is the cost: only then optimise | each change must move a measured number, or it is reverted |

## 7. What would make this project not worth continuing

* C1 below 0.7 times Redis at pipeline 1, where both sides are syscall-bound and the language should not matter: that would
  mean the loop or the connection table has a cost the HTTP numbers hid.
* A log-structured store that cannot hold the gate under overwrite-heavy load because compaction dominates.
* The parser needing an allocation per command to be correct.

Any of these is written up here, in place, as the result.
